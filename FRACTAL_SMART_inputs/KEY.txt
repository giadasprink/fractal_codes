df: the structural properties of the aggregate can be quantified to first order by the "fractal dimension", which describes the morphological dimension of the aggregate: Df = 3 is a compact spherical particle.  Df = 1 describes a linear chain.  When Df < 3 the particle radius is not easily defined.

The radius of a fractal aggregate can be defined by:
nmon = alpha * (Rf / rmon) ^ df
where nmon = the number of monomers contained in the aggregate, alpha is a dimensionless constant (taken to be unity), and rmon is the average monomer radius.  

Fractal particles behave like a bimodal distribution of spherical particles.  Monomers contained within the aggregate interact strongly with shortwave radiation, whereas the bulk size of the aggregate affects longer wavelengths.  

Titan haze refractive indices are assumed.  Fractal aggregates are more absorbing in the UV and more transparent in the visible and NIR than mie particles of equal mass.

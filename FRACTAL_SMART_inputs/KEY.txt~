df: the structural properties of the aggregate can be quantified to first order by the "fractal dimension", which describes the morphological dimension of the aggregate: Df = 3 is a compact spherical particle.  Df = 1 describes a linear chain.  When Df < 3 the particle radius is not easily defined.
